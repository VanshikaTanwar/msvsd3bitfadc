## ALIGN TOOL Installation 

There are some prerequisites needed before installing the ALIGN Tool 

```
1. gcc >=6.1.0(For C++14 support)

2. Python>=3.7
```



Note:- In my UBUNTU 22.04 , 

gcc-9 version is Installed

and python3 3.10 version is installed

**If gcc or python is not installed then install it using the command which are given below:-

```
sudo apt-get install gcc-9
```


 check gcc –version

```
sudo apt-get install python3
```

check python3 –version

NOTE:- It is must to met the prerequisite before installing the tool

For installing the align tool , Just follow these steps which are given below:-

Go to Desktop or that directory/path where you want to install the ALIGN Tool and write these commands which is given below:- 


```
$           export CC=/usr/bin/gcc

$           export CXX=/usr/bin/g++

$            git clone https://github.com/ALIGN-analoglayout/ALIGN-public

$           cd ALIGN-public
```


#### Now we need to create a Python virtual environment

As , we have installed the Python 3 so, follow these commands which are given below inside the ALIGN-public directory:

```
$          python3 -m venv general

$          source general/bin/activate

$          python3 -m pip install pip --upgrade
```

Note :- If you have only python version then , write python command instead of python3 in above commands
