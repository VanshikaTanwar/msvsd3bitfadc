# Week 3 work

## Task To Do this week 

In Week 3 we need to take the Analog Block of 4 bit Asynchronous UP Counter from mixed signal design of it 
from this Github https://github.com/syedimaduddin/4-bit_Asynchronous_Up_Counter_using_Mixed-Signal

So, from this Github repo we need to take the Analog Block and Need to generate its GDS/LEF/DEF file using ALIGN Tool and other related files with help of xschem's Netlist of the design.

AFter this, we need to write the Dummy Verilog Code of Analog Block and also, we need to write the digital verilog code for Digital Block and used in OpenFASOC and then , observe the final Layout.




### Analog Block Ring Oscillator Circuit Diagram in Xschem 

In this design, 4 bit Asynchronous UP Counter using mixed signal - The Analog Block is Ring Oscillator and Digital Block is T Flip Flop .
