# To Do Task WEEK 4

1) As, we have created and verified the ring oscillator analog block of 4 Bit Asynchromous UP Counter in week 3 . Similarly , now we first need to create the 1 bit ADC which is another Analog Block in 4 bit asynchronous UP Counter . 

--> For more details of 4 Bit Asynchronous Counter you can refer or visit this Repo  : https://github.com/syedimaduddin/4-bit_Asynchronous_Up_Counter_using_Mixed-Signal

means , we need to create the 1 bit ADC first in xschem and also need to generate it's layout using ALIGN Tool Flow as done previously . And also need to verify the it's pre-layout and post layout simulation waveform .
