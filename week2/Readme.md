OpenROAD Installation
for installation of OpenROAD follow these steps which are given below:-

``` 
cd
 git clone --recursive https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD.git
 cd OpenROAD
 ./etc/DependencyInstaller.sh
 cd
 git clone --recursive https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD-flow-scripts

## OpenFASoC: Temperature Sensor Generator
## Temperature Sensor Auxiliary Cells
An overview of how the Temperature Sensor Generator (temp-sense-gen) works internally in OpenFASoC

### Circuit
This generator creates a compact mixed-signal temperature sensor based on the topology from this paper. It consists of a ring oscillator whose frequency is controlled by the voltage drop over a MOSFET operating in subthreshold regime, where its dependency on temperature is exponential.

The physical implementation of the analog blocks in the circuit is done using two manually designed standard cells:

1. HEADER cell, containing the transistors in subthreshold operation;

2. SLC cell, containing the Split-Control Level Converter.

The gds and lef files of HEADER and SLC cells are pre-created before the start of the Generator flow.
